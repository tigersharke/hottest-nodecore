So far the water is replaced by pum, seems correct. 

Might consider trying to replace some instances of underground lava with water?

Need to do something for the sponges, where would they hide in this hot world?

Pum sponges need a texture, possibly different appearance, more like lava rock?

Sand should be swapped as well since lava and sand do not exist the same as water and sand.

If I try out a pum sponge as was offered as an idea, I'll need to make the texture first, at
least to make it unique. I might just change the color for initial testing.

I think I may need to sort of conditionally swap some initial pum (smaller pockets
in first worldgen) for a placeholder node, and then to water after the pum swap.

If pum does not affect anything but burnable things or a few recipes, then I'm not
sure I'd swap anything near the new pum placements.

I could convert all trees to ash and a random eggcorn underneath the pile.

MantleCore?

The pumwater sponge will cool and harden in water, or over a specified amount of time if not
 insulated with stone which will also begin to glow from proximity but not melt.

Should a cold pumwater sponge chance to crumble or turn to pumice? A dry sponge can burn, can
it crumble also or is this misremembering?
 
Some of the generating code seems nearly ok, need to "create" the node somewhere.

Need to eliminate pumwater from high locations, especially floating islands which allow it
to foolishly cause pumwater falls.

Incorporate wc_vulcan but disable some bits, do I want volcanoes or should those be included 
only if that mod is added seperately?  i think I dislike some of the vulcanization effects, 
but also, some seem useful perhaps.
